# Simple Firebase Chat App <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3oKIPwoeGErMmaI43S/giphy.gif" width="60" height="50"/>
A simple chat app using firebase real time capabilities. The app lets you communicate with anyone who are also using the app. 
Please note that the app is just made for learning and is lacking many important functionalities.
Contributors are also welcome to contribute to the project. <br/><br/>
You can download the direct apk file [here](https://github.com/ShimShim27/SimpleFirebaseChatApp/blob/master/app/release/app-release.apk).

## ðŸ”§ Setup
* Download and clone the project
* Open the project in your preferred IDE 
* Create a project first on [firebase](https://console.firebase.google.com) if haven't yet. In your firebase project google sign in authentication, 
download google-services.json ,  add the signing certificates , and fix your default firestore security rule. Do your own research about this.
* Build and run the project

## ðŸš« Limitation
As stated above , the project are created just for learning. You'll be also needing to implement the encrytion of messages because the current app stores it as plain text. 
Bugs and crashes may also exists. This is just a skeleton of what a chat app can be.
